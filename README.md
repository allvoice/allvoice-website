[JOIN THE DISCORD](https://discord.gg/bwJFfRRcMB)

This website's goal is to be used as a generic voice library for gamers and game developers to pull from for curated, high quality, AI generated, voiceover models. Generic meaning multiple languagues and games.

## Current Goal

This website is going to support [World of Warcraft VoiceOver](https://github.com/mrthinger/wow-voiceover) in its mission to create high quality voiceovers for all NPCs in Vanilla, TBC, and Wrath. In order to do this there are 2 main functions.

### Creating Voices

allvoice will feature a robust voice editor that makes it easy for anyone to contribute voice models for NPCs.

### Rating Voices

allvoice will allow the community to rate voices, ensuring each NPC has the highest quality voice model selected for it. allvoice should order which voices are most important for the community to rate.

## Contributing

I am going to try to populate this README and github issues with modular pieces of work, but it is high effort. If you'd really like to help [join the discord](https://discord.gg/bwJFfRRcMB) and I (@mrthinger) would be more than happy to hop on a short voicecall and walk you through the project. After the walkthrough, I'll have better perspective on writing a useful beginner guide.
