[JOIN THE DISCORD](https://discord.gg/bwJFfRRcMB)

This website's goal is to be used as a generic voice library for gamers and game developers to pull from for curated, high quality, AI generated, voiceover models. Generic meaning multiple languagues and games.

## Current Goal

This website is going to support [World of Warcraft VoiceOver](https://github.com/mrthinger/wow-voiceover) in its mission to create high quality voiceovers for all NPCs in Vanilla, TBC, and Wrath. In order to do this there are 2 main functions.

### Creating Voices

allvoice will feature a robust voice editor that makes it easy for anyone to contribute voice models for NPCs.

### Rating Voices

allvoice will populate which voices need to be rated by the community to ensure each NPC has the highest quality voice model available for it.


## Contributing

I am going to try to populate this README and github issues with modular pieces of work, but it is high effort. If you'd really like to help [join the discord](https://discord.gg/bwJFfRRcMB) and I (@mrthinger) would be more than happy to hop on a short voicecall and walk you through the project. After the walkthrough, I'll have better perspective on writing a useful beginner guide. 

## Long Term Vision

Game developers should be able to manage voiceover for their games by inserting an SDK that pulls from this site by specifying: 
- description of the character
- spoken text

The site will record when the game requests voiceover and display the requests in a dashboard. The developer will be able to see the suggested voice models given the logged request. When the developer selects which model they'd like to use, a commision + potential upfront payment is given to the voice author whenever its used for generation.

None of the Warcraft models will ever be used for this purpose. I am personally not as invested in this long term vision as I used to be but will support those that wish to take on the vision. If you're interested, message @mrthinger in the [discord](https://discord.gg/bwJFfRRcMB).
